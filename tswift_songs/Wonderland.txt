"Flashing lights and we"
"Took a wrong turn and we"
"Fell down a rabbit hole"
"You held on tight to me"
"Cause nothing's as it seems and spinning out of control"
"Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?"
"Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?"
"Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?"
"Didn't it all seem new and exciting?"
"I felt your arms twistin' round me"
"I should have slept with one eye open at night"
"We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it"
"And we pretended it could last forever (ey, ey)"
"We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it"
"And life was never worse but never better (ey, ey)"
"(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)"
"In Wonderland"
"(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)"
"In Wonderland"
"(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)"
"In Wonderland"
"(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)"
"In Wonderland"
"So we went on our way, too in love to think straight"
"All alone or so it seemed"
"But there was strangers watching"
"And whispers turned to talking"
"And talking turned to screams, oh"
"Didn't they tell us don't rush into things"
"Didn't you flash your green eyes at me"
"Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile"
"Didn't it all feel new and exciting"
"I felt your arms twisting round me"
"Its all fun and games till somebody loses their mind"
"But darlin'"
"We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it"
"And we pretended it could last forever (ey, ey)"
"We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it"
"And life was never worse but never better (ey, ey)"
"(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)"
"In Wonderland"
"(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)"
"In Wonderland"
"(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)"
"In Wonderland"
"(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)"
"In Wonderland"
"I reached for you but you were gone"
"I knew I had to go back home"
"You searched the world for something else"
"To make you feel like what we had"
"And in the end in Wonderland"
"We both went mad"
Oh!
"We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it"
"We pretended it could last forever, last forever (ey, ey)"
"We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it (got lost in it)"
"And life was never worse but never better, never better (ey, ey)"
"(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)"
"We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it (in Wonderland)"
"(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)"
"We pretended it could last forever (in Wonderland)"
"(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)"
"We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it (in Wonderland)"
"(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)"
"And life was never worse but never better"
"In Wonderland"
