"I see your face in my mind as I drive away"
"'Cause none of us thought it was"
"Going to end that way"
"People are people"
"And sometimes we change our minds"
"But it's killing me to see you go after all this time"
"Mm mm mm, mm mm mm, mm mm"
"Mm mm mm, mm mm mm, mm mm"
"Music starts playing like the end of a sad movie"
"It's the kind of ending you"
"Don't really want to see"
"'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you"
Down
"Now I don't know what to be without you around"
"And we know it's never simple, never easy"
"Never a clean break, no one here to"
"Save me"
"You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand"
"And I can't"
Breathe
"Without you but I have to breathe"
"Without you but I have to"
"Never wanted this, never want to see you hurt"
"Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve"
"But people are people"
"And sometimes it doesn't work out"
"Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out"
"It's 2 A.M"
"Feeling like I just lost a friend"
"Hope you know it's not easy"
"Easy for me"
"It's 2 A.M"
"Feeling like I just lost a friend"
"Hope you know this ain't easy"
"Easy for me"
"Sorry, sorry"
"Sorry, (Yeah eh) sorry"
"Sorry, sorry"
Sorry
