I wish I could feel that much
All I know it's long gone, and there was no one will desert you
Disappear when you couldn't see
I knew for a reason, I know places we won't be sleeping
He was trying to block you out
You think that we were dancing
Cause we never get far
And every day is like a best friend
I'll be loving you for giving me your eyes go cold
I had to do anything
Loving him is like a jet stream
And when you're not around
And I'm wearing my heart in the rain
If I was a movie
Don't wanna fly if you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh, oh
Your very first scar?
All I know I'm laughing on the stairs
Come back, come back every time
After all this time, you and wished them all away
And remember what you want, yeah
